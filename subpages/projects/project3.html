                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>The problem my app addresses is food insecurity and providing audience options/means
                    to access healthy food options via a means to apply/track to food stamps and food banks. The
                    audience I plan to target are parents that are of low-income and are full-time students. Many of
                    those that utilize these services are households with children. At the same time, those that are
                    unable to utilize these services the least, wherever eligible or not, are also full-time students,
                    hence the target audience being a mix of both</p>
            </div>

            <div class="projectProcess">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p></p>
                
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>The main need for this is being able to access enough good healthy foods even with low
                    finances. One of the main means of aid is SNAPs (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program).
                    Despite the usefulness of food stamps, eligible people still tend to be off-put from even trying to
                    engage in the signup process due to how complicated and tedious it is. Even after completing the
                    process, there is still the chance of not receiving that much money. Thus a couple of the
                    functions include a pre-screening feature to help the audience see if they are eligible before
                    engaging in the process, an application tracker that includes: estimated processing time, required
                    actions, communication history, and notifications/alerts (mainly to inform/remind the user about
                    the interviews).
                    </p>
                    <p>If the individual isnâ€™t eligible for food stamps, as many students do not have, it brings the
                        worry of having access to healthier food options for them and their children. So, the app will
                        offer geolocations of food banks in a 5-10 mile radius, their date/times they are open, and food
                        trackers (specifically for: fresh fruits, vegetables, low-fat fish, and poultry/eggs). If the food at
                        food banks do not suffice as a substantial source for the household, there would also be a
                        function that shows coupons/deals for healthy food option, omitting/filtering out any unhealthy,
                        sugar/calorie high deals unless the user opts into them</p>
