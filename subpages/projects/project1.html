                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>The challenge is to create a website that promotes the artists and the artworks in the art gallery in a way that highlights the works’ messages. It is meant for OutLoud! to inform and encourage the target audience of black 18 to 26 year olds living in New York to heighten their political awareness by attending openings and events hosted by the gallery.

            <div class="projectProcess">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>Figuring out target audience, doing competitive analysis, and designing</p>
                
                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>The main reason for choosing New York as a level of specificity is to separate myself from the audience. 
                    As for Black Americans, I chose this demographic because of two articles from Pew Research Center titled “Black Americans have a clear vision for Reducing Racism but Little Hope It Will Happen” and “For Black History Month, a look at what Black Americans say is needed to overcome racial inequality.” Essentially, it highlights wishes for social change for equality’s sake but is not seeing actions/improvements being done to reach that goal. Alongside this, black adults believe that voting is an extremely effective tool for black progress (68% of black democrats and 41% of black republicans believe this) hence the political turn on the website’s purpose. 
                    It is important to note that only 2/3rds of the black population in New York engages in voting. Thus by targeting and encouraging them that their voice matters, it may incline them to be more socially and politically aware.
                  The age range is much younger mainly because of the idea that their are the future and will dictate the path we take. Their values and participation provide a sense of urgency in addressing the matters that concern them. In this case, the want for racial equality in all the different sectors of institution. 
               </p>

                <h3>Competitive Anlysis</h3>

                    <img src="../../images/outLoud2.png" alt="competitive analysis of Exhibits of Humanity">
                </div>

                <h3>Designing a Wireframe</h3>
                <p>I want to have an emphasis on aesthetics. Much of the websites I explored, especially the more formal ones are information/word heavy, something that won’t catch the attention of a younger audience. When thinking about New York and a young adult aesthetic, I think of the Maximalist aesthetic, something that is brash and bold. So, the design would be casual while having visual noise to catch the attention of the viewer but still conveying the necessary information clearly in a way that will appeal to a slightly older (25-29 audience). 
                </p>
                <p>The problem is to encourage and compel the target audience to attend events at the art exhibit and providing resources in order to have them think about the media they are consuming and more aware of effect of politics on their daily lives.

                <h2>Final Product</h2>
                <p>The main thing is to get involved in and spread the community, either by attending events or keeping up to date with the online content/resources. There are different ways/options the user can choose to get involved (financially, offering time and effort, sharing to friends and family.) On the webpage, there are different points on the site made to encourage people to join.
