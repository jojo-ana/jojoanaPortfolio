                <p>I wanted to make an informative website on the most recent Persona game from the perspective of a fan.</p>

                <h3>Competetive analysis</h3>
                <p>As my topic is on the video game series, I decided to look at the source. A couple of websites that are on a similar topic include the official Atlus website on the games and a fanmade website to keep up with anything and everything Persona (and Atlus in general) related. The Persona 3 Website does well to showcase the content succinctly and creatively. The design choices made on the Persona 3 website are not just aesthetically pleasing but also highly functional. It organizes the layout effectively organizes information, ensuring that visitors can easily navigate through the website. Whether it's learning about the game's story, characters, or mechanics, users can find what they're looking for without unnecessary clutter or confusion. Just a small critique to mention is the utilization of centered text for the character descriptions. Additionally, this example is not reflective of the amount of content I would like to conclude/compile. Nonetheless, I like the aesthetic and use of chunking to organize it.</p>

                </div>
                <p>For the Atlus fansite called Persona Central, it does well to engage with the content. It gives off the information and allows it to connect to other content in a very straightforward. While this is a good example of having multiple connections to content, visually it is very standard/minimal. The fanmade website provides a different yet equally valuable experience for fans. Despite its visually minimalistic approach, it does well with seamless navigation; where a click will take you makes sense.</p>

                <h3>Design of Website Visuals</h3>
                <p>I personally designed and created all the visuals for this website. This process involved intensive planning and meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that every element aligns with the overall aesthetic and functionality goals. I invested a significant amount of time and effort into the creation, from initial concept sketches to the final polished graphics. Each visual component has been crafted to enhance user experience and engagement, reflecting my commitment to quality and creativity.
